# Coding Temple Week 6: My Own Version of the Weather Project
I made two calls to the openweather API. The first was triggered upon user input of city and state. 
This call goes to the geocoding API which sent back latitude and longitude for the location. 
A second call would is then immediately sent with those coordinates, retrieving selected information from the 'one-call' API. 
I used Axios for the calls. 

I then generated a table of weather data with appropriate icons and metrics, and a conditional pop-up for weather alerts.

This ended up being a pretty straightforward 1-day project. 
It was really run to work with an API in different ways with the Javascript.
